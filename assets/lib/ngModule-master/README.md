ngModule
========

As your AngularJS application gets more complex you will likely come to discover that the ngApp directive has two fairly big limitations:

1. You can only have one ngApp per page.
2. You can only associate a single module with a single HTML element

The ngModule directive gets around these limitations. It allows you to associate more than one module with more than one element.

For a detailed explaination read the original blog post this directive was derived from:

You can also install it using bower:

$ bower install ng-module

(Thanks to Kyle Kemp for that)
